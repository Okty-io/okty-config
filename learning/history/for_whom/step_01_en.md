Docker is a tool designed to benefit **both developers and system administrators**, 
making it a part of many **DevOps** (developers + operations) **toolchains**. 
For developers, it means that they can focus on writing code without worrying 
about the system that it will ultimately be running on. It also allows them to 
get a head start by using one of thousands of programs already designed to run 
in a Docker container as a part of their application.
For operations staff, Docker gives flexibility and potentially reduces the number of systems needed.
