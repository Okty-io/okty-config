Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to **create**, **deploy**, and **run** applications by using containers. 
Containers allow a developer to **package up an application** with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries 
and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, 
**the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine** regardless of any 
customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing 
the code.
